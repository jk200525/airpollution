<h1> <font style="arial black" size=50> Air pollution in China </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> Air pollution in China is a serious environmental issue. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution leads people to be exposed 
to fine particles in polluted air that penetrate deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system, causing diseases including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections. Industry, transportation, coal power plants and household solid fuel usage are major 
contributors to air pollution. Though some progress has been made, air pollution remains at an alarming rate in China, and affects economies and people's 
quality of life. Air pollution is responsible for about 2 million deaths in China per year. Of those deaths, ambient air pollution alone caused more than 
1 million deaths, while household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies caused another million deaths in the same period in China.</p>
<p> China's strict policy action led to a swift reduction in pollution. Particulate pollution in China declined by 42.3 percent between 2013 and 2021 and 
by 5.3 percent from 2020 to 2021 alone. Because of these air quality improvements, the average Chinese citizen can expect to live 2.2 years longer, provided 
the reductions are sustained.</p>

<h1><font style="arial black" size=50>  What all measures are followed to prevent air pollution? </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> China has implemented several measures to combat air pollution. Some of these measures include:</p>
<ul align=left>
<li>Clean Air Actions: The Chinese government has implemented two nationwide Clean Air Actions, the "Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan"
(commonly known as the "Ten Measures") from 2013 to 2017, and the "Three-Year Action Plan to Win the Battle for a Blue Sky" (commonly known as "Blue Sky Battle") 
from 2018 to 2020. These actions aimed to reduce ambient PM2.5 mass concentration in key regions to target levels and were supported by a series of policy and control measures.</li>
<li>Emissions standards: China has implemented strict emissions standards for vehicles and industrial sources of air pollution.</li>
<li>Renewable energy: China is investing heavily in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.</li>
<li>Research and development: China is investing in research and development of new technologies for reducing emissions.</li>

<p align=left> According to a study based on 2017 data, air pollution is responsible for about 2 million deaths in China per year. Of those deaths, ambient air pollution alone caused
 more than 1 million deaths, while household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies caused another million deaths in the same period in China.</p>
 <p align=left>According to Statista, the annual average concentration of air pollutants of 339 cities in China in 2021 was about 48 micrograms per cubic meter .</p>
