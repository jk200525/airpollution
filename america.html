<h1> <font style="arialblack" size=50> Air pollution in US </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), despite significant progress 
in cleaning the air since 1970, air pollution in the United States continues to harm people's 
health and the environment. Today, pollution levels in many areas of the United States exceed 
national air quality standards for at least one of the six common pollutants. The EPA continues 
to work with state, local and tribal governments, other federal agencies, and stakeholders to reduce 
air pollution and the damage that it causes.</p>
<p>A new report by the American Lung Association states that the number of Americans exposed to unhealthy 
spikes in air pollution has been rising consistently. A total of 63.2 million people are being exposed to 
such conditions, up from 49.6 million four years ago. Western states are the worst exposed, largely due to 
major wildfire and drought.</p>
<p>In 2022, about 66 million tons of pollution were emitted into the atmosphere in the United States. 
These emissions mostly contribute to the formation of ozone and particles, the deposition of acids, and visibility impairment.</p>
</font>
<h1><font style="arialblack" size=50>  What all measures are followed to prevent air pollution? </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented several measures to reduce air pollution in the United States. 
Some of these measures include:</p>
<ul align=left>
<li>Regulatory measures: The EPA has set national air quality standards for six common pollutants, including ozone, particulate matter, 
and sulfur dioxide. The agency also regulates emissions from industrial sources, vehicles and engines, and other sources of air pollution.</li>
<li>Regional cooperation: The EPA works with state, local, and tribal governments to develop and implement air pollution control programs .</li>
<li>Voluntary programs: The EPA has established several voluntary programs to encourage businesses and individuals to reduce their emissions 
of air pollutants .</li><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/64271/queen-of-liberty-statue-of-liberty-new-york-liberty-statue-64271.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1600" alt="IMAGE OF AMERICA" height=1000 width=700 align=right>
<li>Research and development: The EPA conducts research to better understand the sources and effects of air pollution and to develop new 
technologies for reducing emissions.</li>
</ul>

<h1><font style="arialblack" size=50> Stats of air polution </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the total emissions of six principal air pollutants in the United States 
have dropped by 73% between 1980 and 2022. During this period, gross domestic product increased by 196%, vehicle miles traveled increased 
by 108%, energy consumption increased by 29%, and the US population grew by 47%.</p>
<p>The EPA has also set national air quality standards for six common pollutants, including ozone, particulate matter, and 
sulfur dioxide. The agency regulates emissions from industrial sources, vehicles and engines, and other sources of air pollution </p>
