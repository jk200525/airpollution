<h1> <font style="arial black" size=50> Air pollution in Australia </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> According to IQAir, the air quality index (AQI) in Australia varies depending on the location. As of September 13, 2023, 
the most polluted city in Australia was Spencer Gulf, South Australia with an AQI of 144, 
followed by Ludmilla, Northern Territory with an AQI of 134. However, it is important to note that Australia’s air 
quality is generally among some of the cleanest in the world.</p>

<h1><font style="arial black" size=50 align=left>  What all measures are followed to prevent air pollution? </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> Australia has implemented measures to reduce air pollution, which have significantly improved the country’s overall air 
quality with positive environmental and health impacts. The National Clean Air Agreement is a joint agreement between the 
Australian Government and state and territory governments to improve air quality and reduce people’s exposure to air pollution.
 The agreement includes setting national standards and regulating imports of polluting products.</p>
<p>At the community level, individuals can take steps to reduce air pollutants by choosing to walk, cycle or take public 
transport instead of driving a car. They can also keep their car in good condition and drive to reduce fuel consumption and 
minimize emissions. Buying items that have low-energy manufacture and use requirements or can be recycled is another way to reduce air pollution.</p>
<p>Here are some additional ways to prevent air pollution:</p>
<ul align=left>
<li>Minimize air pollution from cars: Carpooling, using public transportation, walking, or biking instead of driving alone can help 
reduce the number of cars on the road and decrease emissions.</li>
<li>Save energy: Conserving energy by turning off lights and electronics when not in use, using energy-efficient appliances, and insulating homes can help reduce air pollution.</li>
<li>Take care of wood stoves or fireplaces: Properly maintaining wood stoves or fireplaces can help reduce emissions from burning wood.</li>
<li>Recycle: Recycling reduces the amount of waste that goes into landfills, which can produce harmful gases that contribute to air pollution.</li>
<li>Consume less: Reducing consumption of goods and services can help decrease the amount of energy used in production and transportation, which in turn reduces emissions.</li>
</ul>

<h1><font style="arial black" size=50 align=right> Stats of air polution </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> According to IQAir, the air quality index (AQI) in Australia varies depending on the location. As of September 13, 2023, the most polluted city in Australia 
was Spencer Gulf, South Australia with an AQI of 144.</p>
<p>In terms of air pollution statistics, burning fossil fuels and industrial processes cause about 3,000 premature deaths per year in Australia. However, it is 
important to note that Australia’s air quality is generally among some of the cleanest in the world.</p>
