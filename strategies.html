	<p>Air pollution is a serious issue that affects our health and the environment. Here are some strategies to prevent air pollution:</p><br>
</center>
<ul>
    <li>1. Minimize air pollution from cars: Road transportation is one of the biggest emitters of nitrogen oxides. You can reduce your carbon footprint by using public transportation, walking, or biking instead of driving.</li><br>
    <li>2. Save energy: Conserving energy helps reduce air pollution. You can save energy by turning off lights and electronics when not in use, using energy-efficient appliances, and insulating your home.</li><br>
    <li>3. Consume less and choose sustainable products: Reducing consumption of goods and services can help reduce air pollution. You can also choose sustainable products that are made from eco-friendly materials and have a lower carbon footprint.</li><br>
    <li>4. Plant trees: Trees absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the air. Planting trees in your community can help reduce air pollution.</li><br>
    <li>5. Keep air-purifying indoor plants: Indoor plants can help purify the air inside your home. Some examples of air-purifying plants include spider plants, peace lilies, and snake plants.</li><br>
    <li>6. Use natural products: Many household cleaning products contain harmful chemicals that can contribute to air pollution. You can reduce air pollution by using natural cleaning products or making your own using ingredients like vinegar and baking soda.</li><br>
    <li>7. Raise awareness: Educating others about air pollution and its effects can help raise awareness and encourage people to take action to reduce air pollution </li><br>
