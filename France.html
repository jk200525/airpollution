<h1> <font style="arial black" size=50> Air pollution in France </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> According to the European Environment Agency, air pollution continues to have significant impacts on the health of Europeans, particularly in urban areas. 
The pollutants with the most serious impacts on human health are particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ground-level ozone.
As of October 16, 2023, the air quality index (AQI) in France varies depending on the location.</p>
<p> Parisâ€™ air quality was categorized as "not good" on around 20 percent of the days in 2020. Air pollution in France is estimated to cause over 17,000 
deaths per year, which equated to three percent of the overall deaths in France as of 2019.</p>

<h1><font style="arial black" size=50>  What all measures are followed to prevent air pollution? </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> France has implemented measures to reduce air pollution, which have significantly improved the country's overall air quality with positive environmental 
and health impacts. The European Environment Agency has identified particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ground-level ozone as the pollutants with the 
most serious impacts on human health.</p>
<p>At the national level, France has implemented a number of measures to reduce air pollution. For instance, France has banned all gas heaters at outdoor 
cafes and restaurants since April 2022. State-run schools offer a menu without meat or fish at least once a week, and all supermarkets should reduce 
wasteful packaging to slash plastics use. The establishment or expansion of new airports is now prohibited.</p><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/11783055/pexels-photo-11783055.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1600" alt="IMAGE OF FRANCE" height=500 width=1000>
<p>At the community level, individuals can take steps to reduce air pollutants by choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport instead of driving a car. 
They can also keep their car in good condition and drive to reduce fuel consumption and minimize emissions. Buying items that have low-energy manufacture and 
use requirements or can be recycled is another way to reduce air pollution.</p>
<p>Here are some additional ways to prevent air pollution:</p>
<ul align=left>
<li>Minimize air pollution from cars: Carpooling, using public transportation, walking, or biking instead of driving alone can help reduce the number of cars on 
the road and decrease emission.</li>
<li>Save energy: Conserving energy by turning off lights and electronics when not in use, using energy-efficient appliances, and insulating homes can help reduce air pollution.</li>
<li>Take care of wood stoves or fireplaces: Properly maintaining wood stoves or fireplaces can help reduce emissions from burning wood.</li>
<li>Recycle: Recycling reduces the amount of waste that goes into landfills, which can produce harmful gases that contribute to air pollution.</li>
<li>Consume less: Reducing consumption of goods and services can help decrease the amount of energy used in production and transportation, which in turn reduces emissions.</li>
