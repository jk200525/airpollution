<h1> <font style="arial black" size=50> Air pollution in Japan </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> Air pollution is one of the major environmental issues in Japan. According to Statista, the number of deaths attributable to air pollution 
has been rising continuously to over 44 thousand deaths annually.</p>
<p> The Japanese government has implemented several measures to combat air pollution. Some of these measures include:</p>
<ul align=left>
<li>Emissions standards: Japan has implemented strict emissions standards for vehicles and industrial sources of air pollution.</li>
<li>Renewable energy: Japan is investing heavily in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.</li>
<li>Research and development: Japan is investing in research and development of new technologies for reducing emissions.</li>
</ul>

<font size=5>
<p> Following the increasing number of marine pollution cases alongside the rapid industrialization, the Japanese government enacted the Water Pollution Control Law in 1970.
The law prohibits the discharge of wastewater that does not meet the effluent water quality standards.</p>
<p> As a measure to reduce waste pollution, the Japanese government currently promotes the so-called

the importance of reducing, reusing, and recycling waste. However, the recycling rate of Japan's total waste has remained low at around 20 percent over the past decade.</p>
<p>To improve the air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the country focuses on diversifying its energy mix, with an increased nuclear and renewable energy share. 
In recent years, figures indicated a decline of the total annual greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, there was international criticism that Japan's measures are not 
sufficient to counteract climate change.</p>

<p> The energy conversion sector was the main polluting sector in Japan, causing most carbon dioxide emissions. After the nuclear disaster in Fukushima in 2011, nuclear 
energy was replaced by fossil fuels such as coal and gas, resulting in increased emissions shortly after the disaster.</p>
<p> Another environmental issue that is caused by human activity is the waste pollution of land and oceans. Japan represents one of the largest producers and consumers 
of plastic products, resulting in large amounts of plastic waste. Microplastic pollution poses a threat both to the health of animals and humans, as the tiny pieces of 
degraded plastic absorb harmful chemicals that end up in the food chain.</p>
<p> With the incineration rate of municipal waste increasing to close to 75 percent, incineration was the most widely used waste treatment method, as it can easily reduce 
the volume of waste. Despite filtering technologies, the incineration process produces greenhouse gases that contribute to air pollution and climate change.</p>
