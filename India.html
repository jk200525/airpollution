<h1> <font style="arial black" size=50> Air pollution in India </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> Air pollution in India is a serious environmental issue1. According to a study based on 2016 data, at least 140 million people in India breathe air that 
is 10 times or more over the WHO safe limit. In 2019, 21 out of the 30 most polluted cities in the world were in India. The key sources of air pollution in 
India are industrial pollution, vehicles, crop burning, and waste burning. </p>
<p>The Indian government has launched several initiatives to combat air pollution. In 2015, the government launched the National Air Quality Index (NAQI) 
to monitor air quality across the country. In 2019, it launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) with a tentative national target of 20%-30% reduction 
in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 2024, considering 2017 as the base year for comparison1. The NCAP will be rolled out in 102 cities that are considered to 
have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.</p>
<p>India has also initiated other initiatives such as a 1600-kilometer-long and 5-kilometer-wide The Great Green Wall of Aravalli green ecological corridor 
along Aravalli range from Gujarat to Delhi which will also connect to Shivalik hill range with planting of 1.35 billion (135 crore) new native trees over 10 
years to combat pollution.</p>
