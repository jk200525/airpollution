   1-  Traffic and Transportation: Cairo, the capital city, is notorious for its traffic congestion and a high number of vehicles. This has been a major source of air pollution due to emissions from cars and other vehicles.

</br>
2-Industrial Emissions: Industrial activities and factories release pollutants into the air, further contributing to air pollution, particularly in urban areas.
</br>
3-Agricultural Practices: In some rural areas, agricultural practices, such as burning crop residues, can contribute to air pollution.
</br>
4-Dust and Sandstorms: Egypt experiences dust and sandstorms, which can worsen air quality.
</br>
5-Geographical Factors: Cairo's geographical location in a bowl-shaped valley can trap pollutants, leading to poor air circulation and exacerbating pollution levels.

<h1><font style="arial black">  What all measures are followed to prevent air pollution? </font></h1>
</center>
<justify><font size=5>                      The Egyptian government has been taking steps to address air pollution issues, including introducing regulations to control emissions from vehicles, industrial facilities, and power plants. Additionally, efforts have been made to promote public transportation and raise awareness about the importance of reducing pollution.

For the most current information on air pollution in Egypt, I recommend checking with local environmental agencies, the World Health Organization (WHO), or other reliable sources that regularly monitor and report on air quality.
