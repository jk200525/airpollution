<h1> <font style="arial black" size=50> Air pollution in South Korea </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> Air pollution is a serious environmental issue in Korea. According to a report by the American Lung Association, the Seoul Metropolitan Area
 is among the most polluted cities in the world, and in 2017 Korea had the highest fine particulate matter among OECD member countries. <br>The main 
 cause of fine dust generation in Korea is coal power generation and the use of fossil fuels (oil) in the transportation sectors.</p>
</font>
<h1><font style="arial black" size=50>  What all measures are followed to prevent air pollution? </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> The Korean government has implemented several measures to combat air pollution. Some of these measures include:</p>

<li>Emissions standards: Korea has implemented strict emissions standards for vehicles and industrial sources of air pollution.</li>
<li>Renewable energy: Korea is investing heavily in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.</li>
<li>Research and development: Korea is investing in research and development of new technologies for reducing emissions.</li>
</ul>

<p> From 2016 up until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, greenhouse gas emissions in South Korea had been on the rise. <br>
The halt in production lines and travel possibly contributed to the approximately 70 million metric ton reduction in greenhouse 
gas emissions from 2018 to 2020.<br> The same cannot be said for water quality levels in the country, with five marshes and lakes in the country having worsened from 2019 to 2020. 
<br>Compounding this environmental decline, there were 332 thousand tons of illegal waste in South Korea as of August 2022, making pollution on land another hurdle to overcome.</p>
