<h1> <font style="arial black" size=50> Air pollution in England </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> Air pollution in the United Kingdom has long been considered a significant health issue, 
and it causes numerous other environmental problems such as damage to buildings, forests, and crops. According to IQAir, air pollution nationally has been generally
 dropping (except from ammonia from farming). But despite the overall fall, in many big UK cities safe limits on harmful particulates and oxides of 
 nitrogen - NOx - are still regularly breached. And in London, NOx levels at the roadside have barely dropped at all.</p>
<p> As of April 28, 2022, virtually every home in the UK is subjected to air pollution above World Health Organization guidelines. More than 97% of addresses exceed 
WHO limits for at least one of three key pollutants, while 70% of addresses breach WHO limits for all three.</p>

<h1><font style="arial black" size=50>  What all measures are followed to prevent air pollution? </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> The UK government has implemented measures to reduce air pollution, which have significantly improved the countryâ€™s overall air quality with positive environmental 
and health impacts. The Clean Air Strategy is a comprehensive plan to tackle air pollution and improve air quality in the UK. The strategy includes setting national 
standards and regulating imports of polluting products.</p>
<p> At the community level, individuals can take steps to reduce air pollutants by choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport instead of driving a car. 
They can also keep their car in good condition and drive to reduce fuel consumption and minimize emissions. Buying items that have low-energy manufacture and use 
requirements or can be recycled is another way to reduce air pollution.</p>
<p> Here are some additional ways to prevent air pollution:</p>
<ul align=left>
<li> Minimize air pollution from cars: Carpooling, using public transportation, walking, or biking instead of driving alone can help reduce the number of cars on 
the road and decrease emissions.</li>
<li> Save energy: Conserving energy by turning off lights and electronics when not in use, using energy-efficient appliances, and insulating homes can help reduce air pollution.</li>
<li> Take care of wood stoves or fireplaces: Properly maintaining wood stoves or fireplaces can help reduce emissions from burning wood.</li>
<li> Recycle: Recycling reduces the amount of waste that goes into landfills, which can produce harmful gases that contribute to air pollution.</li>
<li> Consume less: Reducing consumption of goods and services can help decrease the amount of energy used in production and transportation, which in turn reduces emissions.</li>
</ul>
