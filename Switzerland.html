<h1> <font style="arial black" size=50> Air pollution in Switzerland </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p align=right> Air pollution is a significant environmental issue in Switzerland. According to the European Environment Agency, a significant proportion 
of Europeâ€™s urban population lives in cities where EU air quality standards for the protection of human health are regularly exceeded. Air 
pollution continues to have significant impacts on the health of Europeans, particularly in urban areas. These health impacts have economic 
costs, cutting short lives, increasing medical costs and reducing productivity through lost working days. The pollutants with the most serious 
impacts on human health are particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ground-level ozone.</p>
<p align=right>Air quality in Switzerland has improved steadily since the mid-1980s. However, pollution from respirable particulate matter (PM10), ozone (O3) 
and nitrogen oxides (NOX) continues to exceed the legally prescribed ambient limit values. The scale of ammonia (NH3) pollution is also far in 
excess of the critical limit value.</p>

<h1><font style="arial black" size=50 align=left>  What all measures are followed to prevent air pollution? </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p align=left> Switzerland has implemented several measures to combat air pollution. Some of these measures include:</p>
<ul align=left>
<li>Emissions standards: Switzerland has implemented strict emissions standards for vehicles and industrial sources of air pollution.</li>
<li>Renewable energy: Switzerland is investing heavily in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.</li>
<li>Research and development: Switzerland is investing in research and development of new technologies for reducing emissions.</li>
</ul>

<h1><font style="arial black" size=50> Stats of air polution </font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> Air quality in Switzerland has improved steadily since the mid-1980s. Nevertheless, the concentrations of ozone (O3) exceed the ambient limit values over 
a large area, of particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 at several locations and of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at individual locations close to traffic. 
The scale of ammonia (NH3) pollution is also far in excess of the critical limit value.<br>According to Statista, the number of deaths attributable to 
air pollution has been rising continuously to over 44 thousand deaths annually. <br> According to IQAir, the annual average concentration of PM2.5 in 
Switzerland in 2021 was about 9.6 micrograms per cubic meter.</p>
