<h2> Man-made (Artificial) sources</h2><br>
  <p> These are mostly linked to the combustion of several kinds of fuel.Immobile sources entail clouds 
          of smoke from power plants, industrial facilities (manufacturing works) and waste furnaces, 
          as well as incinerators and other sorts of fuel-burning heating devices. In poor and developing countries, archaic biomass 
          burning is the chief cause of air pollution; traditional biomass embraces wood, crop leftovers and excrement.
          Movable sources comprise automobiles, aquatic vessels, and planes.
         Controlled burning is a procedure sometimes used in forest management, agriculture, prairie re-establishment. 
          Fire is an accepted facet of both forest and grassland ecosystem and an organized fire can be an instrument for foresters. 
          Precise burning kindles the sprouting of some desirable trees, thus renewing the forest.Fumes from hair spray, paint, 
          aerosol sprays, varnish and other solvents.
         Waste deposits in landfills create methane. Methane is extremely combustible and may form an explosive and volatile 
         concoction with air. Methane is furthermore an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in a sealed-off space. Suffocation 
         may result if the oxygen concentration goes below 19.5% by displacement.Military resources, such as nuclear weapons, 
         toxic gasses, germ warfare and rocketry.</p>	<br><br>	 
<h2> Natural sources</h2><br>
    <p>
       1. Dirt from natural sources, typically big areas of land with little or no plant life.<br>
       2. Methane, discharged by the breakdown of food (digestion) by animals, for example, cattle.<br>
       3. Smoke and CO from jungle fires.<br>
       4. Volcanic activity, which emits sulphur, chlorine, and ash particulates.<br>
