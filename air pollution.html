<font size=5 color=white>
<p> Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans 
and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding 
either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many 
different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and 
chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, 
and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural 
environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).
 Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.</p><br>
<p> Air quality is closely related to the earth's climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are 
also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.</p><br>
<p> Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, 
heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution 
exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression
and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's 
respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed 
to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics.</p><br>
<p>Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes 3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors 
to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing 2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around
 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world's largest single 
 environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor 
 urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted 
 Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that "9 out of 10 people breathe air containing 
 high levels of pollutants." Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard 
 or neglected.</p>
